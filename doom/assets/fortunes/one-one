It would be surprising if you never died.

How can I expect someone to grow emotionally without some nice juicy math?

The sun is going to burn out one day, enjoy it while it lasts.

Look Ms. Tulip! It's you.

Wait. Do I even have hands?

I'll never get my youthful glow back.

You're not my dentist.

Looks like I'll have to start writing his obituary.

Is that weird for a house? No roof?

DID YOU SAY 60-INCH VOICE!!!!!

Don't want to be in the top 10 though. Too much pressure.

Is your name Tulip because you have a bulbous head?

My mechanical heart breaks again. I hope the warranty's still good.

I'd appreciate it if you stopped breaking everything... unless you'd like me to start writing your obituary.

It's a wacky getting-chased song.

This is my cocoon now.

I miss you already and it's emotionally confusing.

Speaking of dying alone...

Color is the universal falsehood that proves reality is subjective.

Its insides are twisted up in knots, just like me.

Snow is probably made from salt. While ice is made from... big, slippery salt.

Now I remember! I was trapped here for 33 years.

This is what it's like when I'm alone with my thoughts? This is terrible.

Doors should be more like doors and less like holes.

I don't like it when food encourages me to eat food. Don't play the capitalist game, man.

Cake is considered both a solid and a liquid, just like my friend Atticus.
